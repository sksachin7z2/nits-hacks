To Reduce carbon emissions from NIT Silchar Campus

About The Project

Our team "Elif" tried to contribute to reduce the carbon emission in our collge in this way that we will act as moderator between 
student i.e college waste and the to third-party corporations who excel in treating waste. We as a moderator will have created an
web-app in which those sudent belonging to different hostel who will be logging in through our web-app have to go through a certain
predifine standard like the classification of wastes that they will be generated on the basis of toxicity like-

1)Biodegradable,
2)Non Biodegradable,
3)Recyclable and
4)Domestic Hazardous

like Domestic hazardous contain many electronic wastage generated that can never be decomposed and biodegradable is the most safest one
as it will be degraded by environment. Now this type of weight is characterized by certain parameter like weight ,density, toxicity etc. and
in the user adminboard it will show the analytics in terms of graph and it gets updated dynamically everyday and show the status of the 
particular user in form of graph. Now that data will be stored in a database that will send to third-party i.e. authority here they will get
data not from particular user but instead will be grouped in terms of hostel.Each hostel analytics will be shown in form of graph in authority
dashboard about daily wastage generated from that particular hostel nd that data will be stored in a real time database.Now after the authority had
dumbed the wastage the user dashboard will get updated and it will get a notification that "His/Her wastage has been dumped succesfully". Now at the 
year the hostel which gets minimum wastage throughout the year will be rewarded by authority.
